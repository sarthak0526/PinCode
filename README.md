### Postal Code Details App

This project is a React Native application that allows users to retrieve details of postal offices based on a provided 6-digit pincode. Hereâ€™s an overview of its functionality and features:

### Features:
- **Search Functionality**: Users can enter a 6-digit pincode to search for postal office details.
- **Modal Display**: Displays detailed information about each postal office in a modal when a card is tapped.
- **Error Handling**: Handles errors gracefully and displays appropriate messages when no data is found or an invalid pincode is entered.
- **Responsive Design**: Designed to work on various screen sizes using React Native components and styles.

### Components Used:
- **React Hooks**: Utilizes `useState` and `useEffect` for managing component state and performing side effects like API calls.
- **React Native Paper**: Utilizes components like `Card`, `Title`, and `Paragraph` from `react-native-paper` for consistent UI design.
- **Third-party Libraries**: Uses `react-native-vector-icons` for icons and `react-native-gesture-handler` for gesture support.

### How to Use:
1. **Enter Pincode**: Input a valid 6-digit pincode into the text input.
2. **Search**: Press the search button to retrieve postal office details.
3. **View Details**: Tap on a card to view detailed information about a postal office in a modal.
